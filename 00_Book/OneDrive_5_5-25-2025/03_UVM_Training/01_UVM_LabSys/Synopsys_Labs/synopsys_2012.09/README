======================================================================

- VCS  V-2012.09-SP1 or later


**********************************************************************
2. Lab database Installation
======================================================================

1. Execute the following commands to unpack the archive:

        unix$  gzip -dc ces_uvm-1.1_2012.09-SP1.tar.gz | tar xf -

   Or if you are using gtar:

        unix$  gtar xzf ces_uvm-1.1_2012.09-SP1.tar.gz


Multiple account installation:
Since the lab directory structure may contain symbolic links that 
should be preserved instead of being expanded, it is strongly 
recommended that you untar the file directly into each account.
Repeat the following for every user account:

unix$ cd /path/to/user/account1
unix$ gzip -dc /path/to/ces_uvm-1.1_2012.09-SP1.tar.gz | tar xf -
